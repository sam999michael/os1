Exercise 4
1) What is happening at line 499
	cmpl $(NR_syscalls), %eax

	The syscall number stored in eax register is compared with the maximum valid syscall number in the system. If the number in eax is equal to or greater than NR_syscalls, it is a bad system call.

2) In your write-up, identify the six registers closest to esp and which system call argument they store.

	ebx: arg1
	ecx: arg2
	edx: arg3
	esi: arg4
	edi: arg5
	ebp: arg6
